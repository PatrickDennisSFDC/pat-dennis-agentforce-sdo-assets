# Agentforce Actions Setup Guide

## ✅ What's Included

This repository provides **9 consolidated invocable action classes** for Agentforce, each supporting all CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete, Find) in a single class:

1. **AFAccountAction** - Account management with ambiguity handling
2. **AFContactAction** - Contact operations with email/name resolution
3. **AFLeadAction** - Lead management (Company + LastName required) with name/email/company search
4. **AFCaseAction** - Customer service case handling
5. **AFOpportunityAction** - Sales pipeline management
6. **AFTaskAction** - Activity and to-do management
7. **AFMeetingAction** - Custom Meeting object for field sales (pharmaceutical/medical)
8. **AFCustomerOrderAction** - Order management with nested line items

In addition, there are **specialized domain actions**:

- **AFPotentialAdverseEventAction** - CRUD/find for `Potential_Adverse_Event__c`, capturing structured potential adverse event reports with account/contact lookups and semantic field mapping
- **AFProgramCandidateAction** - CRUD/find for `Program_Candidate__c`, supporting post-prescription support enrollment where patients call in after receiving a prescription. Records are created incrementally as information is gathered during phone enrollment calls. Includes comprehensive field mapping for basic info, contact, address, program, eligibility, and insurance information. Features Lightning Path for enrollment status tracking.

All classes:
- ✅ Use `@InvocableMethod` for native Agentforce integration
- ✅ Support operation inference (automatically detect create/read/update/delete/find from context)
- ✅ Include comprehensive labels and descriptions for AI agent guidance
- ✅ Delegate to `AFUniversalCrmRecordAction` for core business logic
- ✅ Handle ambiguous relationships (multiple matching records)
- ✅ Support name-based record resolution (update by name, not just ID)

## 🎯 Key Features

### Operation Inference
Operations can be explicitly specified or automatically inferred:
- **Has `fieldDataJson` + `recordId`** → Update
- **Has `fieldDataJson` only** → Create
- **Has `recordId` only** → Read
- **Has `searchTerm` or `filtersJson`** → Find
- **Has `recordId` only (no data/search)** → Delete

### Ambiguity Handling
When multiple records match (e.g., two "Bob Smith" contacts):
- System detects the ambiguity
- Returns a list of candidates with distinguishing details
- Agent prompts user for clarification
- Prevents silent errors from picking the wrong record

### Name-Based Resolution
Update records without knowing their ID:
- `"Update the Acme Corp account status to Active"` ✅
- System resolves "Acme Corp" to AccountId automatically
- No need to lookup IDs first

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Clone and Authenticate

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/PatrickDennisSFDC/pat-dennis-agentforce-sdo-assets.git
cd pat-dennis-agentforce-sdo-assets

# Authenticate with your Salesforce org
sf org login web --alias myorg
```

### Step 2: Deploy All Metadata

Deploy all Agentforce assets to your org:

```bash
sf project deploy start --source-dir force-app/main/default --target-org myorg
```

This deploys:
- All 9 consolidated action classes
- Core utilities (`AFUniversalCrmRecordAction`, `AFUniversalAnalyticsAction`)
- Custom objects and fields (`Meeting__c`, `CustomerOrders__c`, `Customer_Order_Line_Item__c`, `Potential_Adverse_Event__c`, `Program_Candidate__c`)
- Permission sets
- Page layouts, Lightning Pages, Lightning Paths, Compact Layouts, and List Views

### Step 3: Assign Permission Set (CRITICAL!)

The `AgentCourseSDOCustomAssetPermissions` permission set is **essential** - it grants access to all Apex classes, objects, and fields. Without it, agents won't be able to use any of these actions.

**Option A: Using the Deployment Script (Recommended)**

```bash
./deploy.sh myorg
```

**Option B: Manual Assignment**

```bash
# Assign to your current user
sf org assign permset --name AgentCourseSDOCustomAssetPermissions --target-org myorg

# Or assign to a specific user
sf org assign permset --name AgentCourseSDOCustomAssetPermissions --on-behalf-of user@example.com --target-org myorg
```

**Option C: Via Salesforce UI**

1. Go to **Setup → Users → Permission Sets**
2. Find **"Agentforce SDO Custom Asset Permissions"**
3. Click **"Manage Assignments"**
4. Add your user (or users who will use Agentforce)

### Step 4: Configure Agentforce Agent

1. Navigate to **Setup → Agentforce Agents**
2. Create a new agent or edit an existing one
3. Go to the **Actions** tab (or **Topics** → **General CRM Updates**)
4. Click **"Add Action"** or **"New Action"**
5. Search for the deployed actions:
   - Search for "Agentforce Account Action" → Select `AFAccountAction`
   - Search for "Agentforce Contact Action" → Select `AFContactAction`
   - Search for "Agentforce Lead Action" → Select `AFLeadAction`
   - Search for "Agentforce Case Action" → Select `AFCaseAction`
   - Search for "Agentforce Opportunity Action" → Select `AFOpportunityAction`
   - Search for "Agentforce Task Action" → Select `AFTaskAction`
   - Search for "Agentforce Meeting Action" → Select `AFMeetingAction`
   - Search for "Agentforce Customer Order Action" → Select `AFCustomerOrderAction`
   - Search for "Agentforce Potential Adverse Event Action" → Select `AFPotentialAdverseEventAction`
   - Search for "Agentforce Program Candidate Action" → Select `AFProgramCandidateAction`
6. Add the actions you want your agent to use

**Note**: Each action supports all CRUD operations. You don't need separate actions for create/read/update/delete - the agent will infer the operation from context.

## 📋 Available Operations

Each action class supports these operations:

### Create
- Create single or multiple records
- Field enrichment suggestions
- Preview mode (`confirm=false`) to see what would be created
- Related record resolution (e.g., specify Account by name)

### Read
- Retrieve complete record details by ID
- Includes all fields and related data
- Returns structured Account/Contact/etc. object

### Update
- Update by record ID or by name (automatic resolution)
- Supports partial updates (only specify fields to change)
- Preview mode available
- Related record resolution

### Delete
- Safe deletion with two-step confirmation
- First call with `confirm=false` returns confirmation message
- Second call with `confirm=true` actually deletes
- Cascade handling for related records

### Find
- Intelligent search with `searchTerm` (searches multiple fields)
- Exact-match filters via `filtersJson`
- Returns list of matching records
- Ambiguity handling for multiple matches

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Create Account
**Agent prompt**: *"Create an account called Acme Corp in the Technology industry"*

**Action call**:
- Operation: `create` (or inferred)
- `fieldDataJson`: `{"Name":"Acme Corp","Industry":"Technology"}`
- `confirm`: `true`

**Result**: Account created, returns Account record with ID

### Example 2: Find Contact with Ambiguity
**Agent prompt**: *"Find Bob Smith"*

**Action call**:
- Operation: `find` (or inferred)
- `searchTerm`: `"Bob Smith"`

**If multiple matches**:
- Returns `candidates` list with details
- Agent asks: "I found 2 contacts named Bob Smith. Which one? (1) Bob Smith at Acme Corp, (2) Bob Smith at Globex Inc."

### Example 3: Update by Name
**Agent prompt**: *"Change Acme Corp's industry to Manufacturing"*

**Action call**:
- Operation: `update` (or inferred)
- `fieldDataJson`: `{"Name":"Acme Corp","Industry":"Manufacturing"}`
- System automatically resolves "Acme Corp" to AccountId
- `confirm`: `true`

**Result**: Account updated successfully

### Example 4: Create Customer Order with Line Items
**Agent prompt**: *"Create an order for Acme Corp with 3 items: Widget A (qty 10), Widget B (qty 5)"*

**Action call**:
- Operation: `create`
- `fieldDataJson`: `{"Account__c":"Acme Corp","LineItemsJson":"[{\"Product__c\":\"Widget A\",\"Quantity__c\":10},{\"Product__c\":\"Widget B\",\"Quantity__c\":5}]"}`
- `confirm`: `true`

**Result**: Order and line items created in single transaction

## 🔧 Schema Configuration

When adding actions to an agent, the system automatically generates schema files (`input/schema.json` and `output/schema.json`) based on the Apex class `@InvocableVariable` annotations. These schemas:

- Define input/output structure for the agent
- Include labels and descriptions from Apex classes
- Control UI behavior with `copilotAction` flags:
  - `copilotAction:isUserInput` - Controls whether field appears as form input (set to `false` for conversational experience)
  - `copilotAction:isDisplayable` - Controls whether output is shown directly (set to `false` for conversational responses)
  - `copilotAction:isUsedByPlanner` - Indicates if planner should use output for reasoning (set to `true`)

**Best Practice**: All input fields should have `copilotAction:isUserInput: false` to promote conversational interaction. The agent should extract parameters from natural language rather than presenting forms.

## 🎓 Best Practices

### For AI Agents

1. **Ask for Clarification First**: If a user says "look up an account" without details, ask for the account name or other identifying information BEFORE calling the find action.

2. **Use Operation Inference**: Don't always specify `operation` explicitly - let the system infer from context when possible.

3. **Handle Ambiguity**: When `candidates` are returned, present them to the user and ask for clarification rather than picking the first one.

4. **Preview Before Commit**: For create/update operations, consider using `confirm=false` first to show what would be created, then ask the user to confirm.

5. **Use Natural Language**: Extract field values from natural language (e.g., "lunch" → "In-Person Visit" for Meeting Type) rather than requiring exact picklist values.

### For Developers

1. **Read the Apex Class Descriptions**: The `@InvocableMethod` descriptions contain detailed guidance for agents. Keep them updated.

2. **Test Operation Inference**: Verify that operations are correctly inferred from various input combinations.

3. **Handle Edge Cases**: Test ambiguity scenarios, empty results, and error conditions.

4. **Monitor Agent Behavior**: Watch how agents use these actions and refine descriptions based on actual usage.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Permission denied" or "Insufficient access"
- **Solution**: Make sure you've assigned the `AgentCourseSDOCustomAssetPermissions` permission set (Step 3)

### "Action not found" in Agentforce
- **Solution**: Verify the deployment succeeded (Step 2) and refresh the Actions tab in Agentforce

### "Object not found" errors
- **Solution**: Ensure custom objects (`Meeting__c`, `CustomerOrders__c`) were deployed successfully

### Agent keeps asking for the same information
- **Solution**: Check that `copilotAction:isUserInput` is set to `false` in schema files to enable conversational extraction

### Operation inference not working
- **Solution**: Verify you're providing the correct input parameters. Check the `@InvocableMethod` description in the Apex class for guidance.

Salesforce Database
```

All action classes delegate to `AFUniversalCrmRecordAction` for:
- Dynamic SOQL generation
- Field enrichment suggestions
- Ambiguous relationship detection
- Name-based record resolution
- Transaction management

This architecture ensures:
- ✅ Single source of truth for business logic
- ✅ Consistent behavior across all objects
