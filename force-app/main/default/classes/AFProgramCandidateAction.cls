/**
 * AF Program Candidate Action
 * Consolidated invocable action for all Program_Candidate__c CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete, Find)
 * Designed for Agentforce AI agents
 * 
 * Use Case: Post-prescription support enrollment where patients call in after receiving a prescription
 * and AI agents capture candidate information through conversation to enroll them in support programs.
 * Records are created incrementally as information is gathered during phone enrollment calls.

            description='JSON string containing Program Candidate field data. All fields are optional in Salesforce, but for COMPLETE ENROLLMENT you should collect ALL information before submitting. WORKFLOW: Always call with confirm=false FIRST to preview what would be created (this does NOT create the record). Check the response for suggestedFields and previewData. The system will tell you what fields are missing. Continue asking questions and calling with confirm=false until you have collected all available information. Only call with confirm=true when ready to submit. FIELD COLLECTION GUIDE - Collect in this order but be flexible based on user responses: (1) Basic Information: "First Name" → FirstName__c, "Last Name" → LastName__c, "Date of Birth" or "DOB" → Date_of_Birth__c (format: YYYY-MM-DD, accept "July 14 1997" and convert). (2) Contact Information: "Phone" or "Phone Number" → Phone__c, "Email" or "Email Address" → Email__c, "Preferred Contact Method" → Preferred_Contact_Method__c (query availableFieldsJson for values: Phone, Email, Text, Mail), "Language" or "Language Preference" → Language_Preference__c (query availableFieldsJson for values: English (default), Spanish, French, German, Other). (3) Address: Parse full addresses into "Street" or "Street Address" → Street__c, "City" → City__c, "State" → State__c, "Postal Code" or "ZIP Code" → Postal_Code__c, "Country" → Country__c (defaults to "United States" if not specified). (4) Program Information: "Program Name" or "Medication Name" or "Drug Name" → Program_Name__c (typically the prescribed drug/medication name). (5) Eligibility (ESSENTIAL - ask before submitting): "Household Size" → Household_Size__c (query availableFieldsJson for values: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 or more, Prefer not to answer), "Income" or "Annual Income" → Annual_Income__c (query availableFieldsJson for income ranges). Ask: "To help determine eligibility, I\'ll need to know your household size and approximate annual income." (6) Insurance Information (ESSENTIAL - ask before submitting): "Insurance Provider" → Insurance_Provider__c, "Insurance Policy Number" or "Policy Number" or "Member ID" → Insurance_Policy_Number__c, "Insurance Group Number" or "Group Number" → Insurance_Group_Number__c. Ask: "Do you have your insurance card handy? I\'ll need your insurance provider name, policy number, and group number." If user declines to provide insurance or eligibility, you can still submit but note it in your message. (7) Notes (OPTIONAL but valuable): "Notes" → Notes__c (rich text field). Use this field to capture a summary of the enrollment conversation, any remarkable comments from the patient, overall interaction context, or notable details that would be valuable for human users reviewing the record. Do NOT recount all field values - focus on interaction summary, context, and remarkable comments. For example: "Patient mentioned they have been struggling with medication adherence in the past and are hopeful this program will help." or "Patient expressed concern about insurance coverage but was relieved to learn about the program." Account/Contact: Use accountName parameter for Account__c, contactNameOrEmail parameter for Contact__c (do NOT put Account__c or Contact__c in fieldDataJson). Example: {"LastName__c":"Smith","FirstName__c":"John","Date_of_Birth__c":"1980-05-15","Phone__c":"555-123-4567","Email__c":"john.smith@example.com","Preferred_Contact_Method__c":"Phone","Language_Preference__c":"English","Street__c":"123 Main St","City__c":"San Francisco","State__c":"CA","Postal_Code__c":"94105","Country__c":"United States","Program_Name__c":"Product XYZ","Enrollment_Status__c":"New Inquiry","Household_Size__c":"3","Annual_Income__c":"75000_to_99999","Insurance_Provider__c":"Blue Cross Blue Shield","Insurance_Policy_Number__c":"POL123456","Insurance_Group_Number__c":"GRP789","Notes__c":"Patient was very engaged during the call and asked several questions about program benefits. Mentioned previous challenges with medication adherence and is optimistic about the support program."}. Query availableFieldsJson to see valid picklist options.'
